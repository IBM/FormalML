This subdirectory contains the [`elfic`](https://www.lri.fr/~sboldo/elfic/) library, which provided a [formal proof of the Lax-Milgram theorem](https://hal.inria.fr/hal-01391578/document). 

We use this library as a dependency for our project, with permission from the authors. 
In particular, we use the Banach Fixed Point theorem as proven in the file `fixed_point.v`.
