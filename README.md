# Formal_ML [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/IBM/FormalML.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/IBM/FormalML)
Formalization of Machine Learning Theory with Applications to Program Synthesis

This repository contains a partial formalization of key results from https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.07795

## Getting Started

To compile the Coq code in this repository, first install opam [opam (ocaml package manager)](https://opam.ocaml.org/).
Add support for coq ocaml repositories: `opam repo add coq-released --set-default https://coq.inria.fr/opam/released`.
If you want to create a local environment (switch), you can run `opam switch create nnsopt 4.07.0`.
Next, run `opam install . --deps-only`.  This should install all the dependencies needed, including Coq.

Once the prerequisites are installed, run `make` to compile it.

Alternatively, the included Docker file can be built using Docker to compile the coq code in a suitable environment.
`docker build --build-arg=coq_image="coqorg/coq:8.8.2" --pull -t nn_sopt .`
